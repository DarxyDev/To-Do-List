# To-Do-List

-add 'are you sure' prompt to _onDeleteCat and deleteTask
-find better priority implementation than opacity and '!' priority widget

issues: 
-double clicking delete task removes the next task without deleting the element.
-must prevent users from selecting date before today - currently using inefficient while loop to fix issues
